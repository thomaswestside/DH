## Letter One - Gladys Chu, 23 July 76

23 July 76

David dear...

CONGRATULATIONS!!!

Thank you for calling to tell me - you deserved the Honors in Chinese and History - you know that.  I'm glad and relieved that you are all settled (for the coming year at least) and that you are happy and satisfied and hopeful. No more problems, right? Let's make it a good year.

Forgive me for my stubborn fears and demands. I have been trying to blot out my feelings about you in order to let other thoughts  (non-emotional, rational, objective thoughts) have a chance to get through. I guess that's why I have been so confusing & contradictory. But my feelings about you are still strong - despite what you may think, I miss being with you, talking with you, sharing... On paper, this all sounds so corny - writing is always such a struggle for me. Let me just say that, if you still want to, let's get together sometime before you go back home if we can, o.k.? I would like to very much.  The August schedule should be posted pretty soon - I'll let you know how things stand with that. When are you leaving New Haven? Let me know what you think of this... if you have had any second thoughts & feel you don't want to see me till Sept; fine.

How is your poetry coming? Did you ever finish the poem you started? The one you read me part of? here's one I wrote, in the space of time when everything had gone to shreds between us - (crossout) right after that awful argument we had. Missing spurs art, no?

<sup id="fn1">*</sup> This is the same man who gave me the roots to prevent my being whipped by Mr. Covey. He was "a clever soul." We used frequently to talk about the fight with Covey, and as often as we did so, he would claim my success as the result of the roots which he gave me. This superstition is very common among the more ignorant slaves. A slave seldom dies but that his death is attributed to trickery. [&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;](#ref1)

<sup id="fn4">*</sup> I am told that colored persons can now get employment at calking in New Bedford—a result of anti-slavery effort. [&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;](#ref4)
